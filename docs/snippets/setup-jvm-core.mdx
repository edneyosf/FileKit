FileKit needs to have your application id to handle the app directory. Your application id is generally the package name or the name of your application. FileKit will use this `appId` as app directory.

We recommend you to initialize FileKit in your `main.kt` file:

```kotlin main.kt
fun main() {
  // Initialize FileKit
  FileKit.init(appId = "MyApplication")

  // Start your application
  application {
      Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication) {
          // ...
      }
  }
}
```

The application ID is used to create user-specific directories on different operating systems:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\your.application.id\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/your.application.id/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/your.application.id/`

#### ProGuard Configuration

If you're using ProGuard or code obfuscation on JVM platforms, add these rules to your `proguard-rules.pro`:

```proguard
-keep class com.sun.jna.** { *; }
-keep class * implements com.sun.jna.** { *; }
```
