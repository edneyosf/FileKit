FileKit v0.10 is a full rewrite of the library. It introduces a new API that is more consistent and easier to use. Also, it introduces new concepts that make it easier to work with files and directories on different platforms.

## Migration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Package names changed">
    The package names have been renamed to match the new API.

    ```kotlin {3, 7}
    // filekit-core renamed to filekit-dialogs
    implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core:0.8.8")
    implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs:0.10.0")

    // filekit-compose renamed to filekit-dialogs-compose
    implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-compose:0.8.8")
    implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs-compose:0.10.0")
    ```

    <Info>
      The `filekit-core` package still exists but it only contains the core functionality of the library like [PlatformFile](/core/platform-file) without any dialogs capabilities.
    </Info>

    Check the [Installation](/installation) page to learn more about the different modules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Renamed methods">
    Some methods have been renamed to match the new API. Also, some arguments may have been changed but the behavior is the same.

    ```kotlin
    // Before
    FileKit.pickFile()
    FileKit.pickDirectory()
    FileKit.saveFile()

    // After
    FileKit.openFilePicker()
    FileKit.openDirectoryPicker()
    FileKit.openFileSaver()
    ```

    Read more about the new API in the [FileKit Dialogs](/dialogs/setup) documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Changes in the saving file feature">
    `FileKit.openFileSaver()` does not accept taking `bytes` as parameter. Now, it only returns the path where the user has chosen to save the file.
    We can now use the returned `PlatformFile` to save the bytes to the file.

    ```kotlin
    // Before
    FileKit.saveFile(bytes)

    // After
    val file = FileKit.openFileSaver()
    file?.write(bytes)
    ```

    On web targets, opening the file saver is not possible anymore due to browser limitations. Instead, FileKit provides a `download()` function that can be used to download a file from the web.

    ```kotlin
    FileKit.download(bytes, "file.txt")
    ```

    Take a look at the [Writing files](/core/write-file) documentation to learn more about the new API.
